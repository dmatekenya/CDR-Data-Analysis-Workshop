# CDR Data Processing with Python

The material in this repository was presented at a training workshop in **Freetown, Sierra Leone** on *August 5, 2019*. The training was organized by **The Directorate of Science Technology and Innovation (DSTI)** and t**he World Bank Group** as part of capacity building efforts under the **The World Bank's Freetown Integrated Transport Project**.

# Course Outline and Goals
The goal of the one day training workshop is to introduce participants to tools and techniques for handling large scale CDR data from mobile phones. In particular, the course focuses on use of Python and Apache Spark computing framework to generate mobility indicators from CDRs.


# Repository Setup
